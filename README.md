# DBMS-Mini-Project Resort Booking System


Welcome to the resort venue booking system, where we offer a seamless platform for customers to book venues for their events while providing administrators with powerful tools to view user accounts and bookings. With our user-friendly interface and robust features, we strive to enhance the overall experience for both customers and administrators. For customers, our system allows them to create an account, log in, and easily book a venue for their event. During the account creation process, customers provide essential information such as their name, email address, mobile number, and password. This information enables them to access their account at any time and manage their bookings efficiently. Customers can conveniently book events based on their preferred location and event type, ensuring that they find the perfect setting for their special occasion. Additionally, they have the flexibility to view their booking history. On the other hand, administrators play a role in the viewing e booking system. They have access to comprehensive details of all customers and their respective 
bookings. 
By implementing our resort venue booking system, we aim to provide a convenient and efficient solution for customers to secure their desired event venues while simplifying the administrative tasks for the venue management team. Our system not only improves the overall customer experience but also boosts the productivity and effectiveness of the entire booking process.
