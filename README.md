# DBMS-Mini-Project Resort Venue Booking System

The objective of this mini project is to design and develop a venue booking system using PHP and a database management system (DBMS). The system is designed to provide a simple and efficient way for users to book venues for events, birthdays, and other occasions. Users can register and log in to the system to view available venues, select a suitable venue, and book it for a specific date and time. The system ensures that the venue is available for the requested date and time. The system stores all the data related to the venues, bookings, and users in a database, allowing for easy retrieval and management of the information. The system is expected to provide a secure and user friendly platform for users to book venues hassle-free.

# Technologies Used : 

Back-end technology: 

PHP: PHP is a general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to serverside web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere. With PHP, it is possible to connect to and manipulate databases. 
Database: 

MySQL: MySQL is a freely available open source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is the most popular language for adding, accessing and managing content in a database. It is most noted for its quick processing, proven reliability, ease and flexibility of use. MySQL is the most popular database system used with PHP. 

Front-end :

i. HTML: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications .In the project, a responsive web design has been developed using HTML .HTML is used to structure the look and layout of a webpage. 

ii. CSS: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to describe the design elements of the websites such as the layout, color, font size, etc. It can allow multiple pages to share the same formatting. CSS has been used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.CSS is used to define styles for web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. 

iii. JavaScript: JavaScript is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web .In the project, HTML form validations have been done using JavaScript. JavaScript provides the facility to validate the form on the client side so that processing will be faster as compared to server side validations. Through JavaScript, we can validate name, password, email, mobile number etc.
